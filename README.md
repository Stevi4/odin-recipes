# odin-recipes

This is the first project I created following The Odin Project's courses.
It contains 3 recipes for varying dishes and a navigation page. Having
worked with HTML previously in school, it came easily. If I ever revisit
this project, I would improve it by properly linking my sources for the
recipes, adding new recipes and categorizing them, and stylizing the page.
